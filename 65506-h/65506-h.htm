</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01a.jpg" id="ncfig2" alt="untitled" width="384" height="229" />
</div>
<p><b>1. Prepare Fruit</b>: Select fully ripe fruit. Wash, then prepare
exactly as recipe directs. If fruit lacks tartness add &frac14; cup
lemon juice when adding sugar. For separating juice for
jelly, use 1-yard square of Canton flannel, spread over colander.
Place prepared fruit in cloth, bring corners together and
twist while pressing down on bag. To make jellies from
dripped juice, use twice amount of fruit called for in recipe.</p>

</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01c.jpg" id="ncfig4" alt="untitled" width="392" height="229" />
</div>
<p><b>2. Prepare Glasses</b>: Wash, scald, and drain the glasses and
tin covers needed, and melt paraffin in a small pot over hot
water while making jelly or jam. Use new paraffin; old
paraffin often causes spoilage. If tin covers are not available,
cut out circles of paper to paste over tops of glasses.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01d.jpg" id="ncfig5" alt="untitled" width="381" height="231" />
</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01e.jpg" id="ncfig6" alt="untitled" width="382" height="224" />
</div>
<p><b>3. Measure Sugar and Fruit</b>: Use the same standard measuring
cup, holding &frac12; pint, level full, for both sugar and fruit.
If sugar is weighed, weigh fruit also. To measure fruit
for jam, pack solidly into cup until juice and fruit come
to top. If there is a slight shortage, fill last cup, or fraction
of cup, with water. If not quite enough juice for
jelly, mix water with pulp in jelly bag and squeeze again.</p>

</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01g.jpg" id="ncfig8" alt="untitled" width="384" height="230" />
</div>
<p><b>4. Cook Rapidly</b>: For quickest jelly making, use an aluminum
kettle or saucepan&mdash;6 to 8 quart size. The kettle
or saucepan should be less than one-half full of sugar
and fruit to permit a <i>full rolling boil</i>, a boil which cannot
be stirred down. Use hottest flame. If fire is slow,
keep kettle covered after sugar is dissolved until mixture
comes to a boil. Stir while coming to a boil, and
while boiling.</p>

</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01k.jpg" id="ncfig10" alt="untitled" width="385" height="223" />
</div>
<p><b>5. Add Certo</b>: For <i>jelly, add Certo as soon as fruit juice
and sugar mixture comes to a boil</i>; then bring to a full
rolling boil and boil hard for exactly &frac12; minute, stirring
constantly. For <i>jam</i>, cook fruit and sugar mixture at full
rolling boil for exactly 1 minute, stirring constantly; then
<i>remove from fire and stir in Certo</i>. Time boil by the clock.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p01n.jpg" id="ncfig12" alt="untitled" width="382" height="222" />
</div>
<p><b>6. Skim, Pour, Paraffin</b>: Skim jelly and pour directly
from saucepan into clean, freshly scalded glasses. Skim
and stir jam for 5 minutes by turns. This cooling helps
prevent floating fruit. Ladle into glasses. Leave &frac12;-inch
space at top of each glass. Cover at once with &#8539; inch
of hot paraffin. When cool, cover glasses with scalded tin
covers or tightly pasted paper covers. Be sure to store in
cool, dry place.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c35"><span class="small">IMPORTANT DO&rsquo;S AND DON&rsquo;TS FOR JELLY MAKERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="ss">DON&rsquo;T</span>&mdash;double Certo recipes. Better color and
flavor and more certain results are obtained
from single batches.</p>
<p><span class="ss">DO</span>&mdash;use fully ripe fruit of the best possible
color and flavor. Taste fruit, and if it lacks
tartness, add the juice of 2 medium lemons
(&frac14; cup) when adding sugar.</p>
<p><span class="ss">DO</span>&mdash;prepare fruit exactly as the recipes direct.
Do not simmer before crushing or squeezing
unless recipes specify cooking. For crushing
fruit, a food chopper is convenient.</p>
<p><span class="ss">DO</span>&mdash;measure sugar and fruit exactly with the
same standard &frac12;-pint measuring cup, level
full; or weigh both. A standard measuring cup
holds &frac12; pint sugar (7 oz. by weight) or &frac12;
pint fruit or juice (8 oz. by weight).</p>
<p><span class="ss">DO</span>&mdash;use a large enough kettle so that your
mixture has room enough to boil <i>hard</i>. A kettle
of 6- to 8-quart capacity is recommended.
If the 6-quart size is used for jam, add &frac14; teaspoon
butter with sugar to reduce foaming.</p>
<p><span class="ss">DON&rsquo;T</span>&mdash;confuse a gentle simmering boil with
the <i>full rolling boil</i> specified in Certo recipes.
A full rolling boil is a high, tumbling boil that
cannot be stirred down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p><span class="ss">DO</span>&mdash;time the full rolling boil by the clock.</p>
<p><span class="ss">DO</span>&mdash;stir and skim jams by turns for just 5
minutes before pouring. This slight cooling
helps prevent floating fruit.</p>
<p><span class="ss">DON&rsquo;T</span>&mdash;expose jellies and jams to dust or
dampness after they are made. Spoilage is
caused by the growth of yeast and mold
plants, which are usually carried by dust. Use
clean glasses, new paraffin, and clean covers.
Paraffin hot jelly and jam at once. Fill glasses
only to within &frac12; inch of top. Store in a cool,
dry place.</p>
<p><span class="ss">DON&rsquo;T</span>&mdash;judge the texture of your jellies or
jams too hastily. Certo recipes are designed
to give an ideal set at the time they are most
apt to be used. Many grow progressively
firmer for a week to a month after they are
made.</p>
<h2 id="c36"><span class="small">NEWS ABOUT PECTIN</span></h2>
<p><b class="small">Do you know that pectin, which helps you make delicious
jams and jellies, plays a role in medicine, too?</b></p>
<p><b class="small">DOCTORS have long used apple pectin in the treatment of
diarrhea&mdash;especially with young children. Good results
here have led to further discoveries of the effectiveness of
pectin in the treatment of many intestinal disorders and
also in the dressing of wounds and burns. Pectin made by
the makers of Certo is being used in several of these scientific

<h2 id="c71"><span class="small">PERFECT JAMS AND JELLIES</span></h2>
<p>Have you ever stopped to think why certain jellies and
jams walk off with the blue ribbons in jelly-contests and
win cheers from all the family ... just what does stand
for perfection in a jelly or a jam?</p>
<p>The Bureau of Home Economics &ldquo;Score Card for Jelly&rdquo;
rates jellies for flavor, texture, and color, and gives 78%
of a score of 100 for perfect flavor and texture. Flavor is
defined as &ldquo;free from excessive sweetness, acid, or overcooked
flavor&rdquo;; perfect texture is &ldquo;jelly that holds its
shape when turned onto a plate, but quivers when the
plate is moved.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="center">Why Certo Recipes Win</h3>
<p>Certo jelly recipes are developed with fully ripe fruit instead
of the under-ripe fruit commonly used in old-fashioned
jelly making. They take you a long way toward perfect
flavor. And Certo jelly recipes are designed to give best
texture at the time the jelly is most apt to be used. They
take account of the fact that many jellies grow progressively
firmer for a week to a month after they are made.</p>
<p>About the ideal texture for jams there is far less
agreement than for jellies. Some prefer jams that hold
their shapes, others like softer jams. Either texture may
be had with Certo jams. If a jam seems stiffer than desired,
break it up with a fork before turning out of the glass.</p>
<p><b><i>The Short-Boil Method</i></b>: Scores of state fair champions in jam
and jelly making and millions of other jelly makers, too,
use Certo and the short-boil method of jelly making. They
know they can depend on Certo for sure results, time and
money saving, and better, richer-flavored jams and jellies.</p>
<p>You may find that Certo recipes call for more sugar than
you usually use. Remember that with Certo no fruit juice
boils away in steam and you usually get half again more
glasses. Thus the extra sugar takes care of the extra juice.</p>
<h3 class="center">HOW TO MAKE JAMS AND JELLIES WITH CERTO
<br /><i>using 25% to 50% less sugar</i></h3>
<p>In any Certo recipe, 2 cups (1&frac12; lbs.) of light corn syrup
may be substituted for 2 cups (14 oz.) of sugar required.
Results will not be satisfactory if more than 2 cups of
corn syrup are used.</p>

<p>Mrs. A and Mrs. B both wanted to make some
raspberry jam. Each had 2 quarts of berries to begin
with and after cleaning and crushing them each
got the same amount of prepared fruit&mdash;4 cups.</p>
<p>Both Mrs. A and Mrs. B <img class="inline" src="images/p02.jpg" alt="9 o&rsquo;clock" width="130" height="130" /> started at 9 o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Mrs. A added 6&frac12; cups of
sugar to her fruit. Then Mrs.
A simply brought her fruit
and sugar to a tumbling
boil, boiled for 1 minute,
removed it from the
stove and added &frac12; bottle
of Certo. The jam was done
and it had all of the flavor
of fresh, ripe fruit.</p>
<p class="center"><img class="inline" src="images/p02e.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="143" height="196" /></p>
<p>Mrs. A was finished at 9:12.</p>
<p class="center"><img class="inline" src="images/p02g.jpg" alt="9:12" width="119" height="122" /></p>
<p>Mrs. B added 4 cups of
sugar. Then Mrs. B, following
the old-fashioned &ldquo;cup
for cup&rdquo; recipe, had to boil
her fruit and sugar about
30 minutes before the jam
thickened. This long boiling
evaporated more than a
third of the prepared fruit
and carried off most of the
natural fresh fruit flavor in
steam.</p>
<p class="center"><img class="inline" src="images/p02f.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="144" height="114" /></p>
<p>Mrs. B was finished at 9:45.</p>
<p class="center"><img class="inline" src="images/p02h.jpg" alt="9:45" width="122" height="123" /></p>
<p>Mrs. A got 10 glasses of jam from her 2 quarts of berries.</p>
<p class="center"><img class="inline" src="images/p02k.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="516" height="62" /></p>
<p>Mrs. B took 3 times as long and got only 6 glasses of jam.</p>
<p class="center"><img class="inline" src="images/p02m.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="314" height="63" /></p>
<p>Mrs. A had shown Mrs. B exactly what she meant when
she said, &ldquo;Certo really pays for itself!&rdquo;</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
